# One Piece — Canon Counter

https://onepiece.kolbyml.com/

A tiny, single-file web page that lets you enter your latest **One Piece** episode and instantly shows your **manga-canon progress** by subtracting filler (and, optionally, mixed/anime-canon episodes). No builds, no server, no tracking—just open `index.html`.

## 🚀 Quick Start

2. Open it in any modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari).
3. Enter the last episode you watched.
4. Use the toggles to choose which categories to subtract.

> Tip: The “Copy sharable link” button lets you bookmark or send your exact settings.

## 🧭 How it works

- The page stores known episode ranges for three categories:
  - `FILLER` — pure anime-only stories
  - `MIXED` — episodes mixing canon and non-canon elements
  - `ANIME_CANON` — anime-original but not considered “filler”
- Given your episode `N`, it subtracts the count of every episode ≤ `N`
  that falls into the enabled categories and shows the **Canon progress**.

Everything runs in your browser; there’s no backend or API.

## 🔗 URL Parameters

You can prefill the page and toggles via query params:

- `count` — latest episode number (integer)
- `f` — subtract filler (1/0)
- `m` — subtract mixed (1/0)
- `a` — subtract anime-canon (1/0)

**Example:**

```
index.html?count=171&f=1&m=0&a=0
```

## 🛠️ Updating the lists

Open `index.html` and edit the arrays near the bottom:

```js
// Episode ranges (inclusive)
const FILLER = [
  [54,60], [98,99], /* ... */
];

const MIXED = [
  [45,47], [61,61], /* ... */
];

const ANIME_CANON = [
  [50,51], [93,93], /* ... */
];
```

Each pair `[start, end]` means “from start to end, inclusive”.
To add a single episode, use `[102,102]`.

> Classification can vary slightly between sources. If your preferred guide
> differs, just adjust the ranges to match that source.

## 📦 Development

There’s no build step. If you want to tweak styles/scripts:

- Edit inline `<style>` and `<script>` in `index.html`
- Test by opening the file directly in your browser
- Commit and push—done

## ❓ FAQ

**Why does my canon count differ from another website?**  
Different sources sometimes classify certain recap/special/mixed episodes differently.
This tool is intentionally editable so you can align it with your preferred list.

**Does this collect analytics or use cookies?**  
No. It uses `localStorage` only to remember your input and toggle preferences on your device.

**Does it work offline?**  
Yes—once you have `index.html`, you can run it without internet.

## 🔒 Privacy

- No network calls, no external dependencies.
- State is stored locally in your browser (`localStorage`).
- Shareable URLs include your current inputs and toggles (so treat them like any link).
